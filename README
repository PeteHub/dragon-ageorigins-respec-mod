===============
The latest version of the addin and it's source code is up on the site.

1.6 - Added: Welcome screen
1.6 - Added: A couple of random RP lines

Known Issues v1.6
==============
- If the player cancels the respecialization the potion might become unusable for everyone else but the character that tried to respec. Working on the fix, in the meanwhile just delete the potion and get a new one.

As always, I'm looking forward to any kind of feedback!

Enjoy

HOW TO USE IT
============
Look for a Raven next to the fallen tree in the player camp or next to the ruined statue in the exterior of Flemeth's hut.

Hold TAB key to find them easier or check the screenshots from the gallery.

INSTALLATION
===========

Use "bin_ship\daupdater.exe" from your Dragon Age Origins installation directory to install downloadable content.

In case you experience serious problems and wish to remove the addon, all you have to do is delete the "WRK_RESPEC_MOD" folder from: 
Documents\\BioWare\\Dragon Age\\AddIns\WRK_RESPEC_MOD

IMPORTANT
===========
This mod pokes around with your character statistics, use it at your own risk.
At least make a savegame before you try it. 

The mod does not grant you character specializations that are tied to the campaign, such as Champion, Reaver, Blood Mage and Duelist. However, if you have aquired these specializations throughout the storyline you are not loosing them either.

The mod takes into account all kind of bonuses you gain to your base stats during your adventure, including the points you get during the Fade and from skill books all around the world.

USE THE SOURCE CODE AT YOUR OWN RISK. YOU CAN CAUSE SERIOUS HARM TO YOUR GAME IF YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION
